   ![Alt text](./images/47.jpg "create graph")

37. Add one more "python2operator" in the graph. Add two input ports: input1 and input2 and one output port as output1 to this operator as described in step 25th to 28th.
   
   ![Alt text](./images/48.jpg "create graph")

38. Join text analysis connector with python operator input one as shown in the screenshot.
   
   ![Alt text](./images/49.jpg "create graph")
   
39. Join first python2operator’s output port 2 to second python operator’s input port 2.
   
   ![Alt text](./images/50.jpg "create graph")
